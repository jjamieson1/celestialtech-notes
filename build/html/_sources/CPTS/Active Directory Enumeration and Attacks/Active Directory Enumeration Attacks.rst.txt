Active directory came out in 2000 with the release of Windows Server 2000.  Active Directory (AD) is based
on the x.500 protocol.  AD provides structures for:

- Users
- Groups
- Network Devices
- File shares
- Policies
- devices and trusts

AD provides authentication, accounting and authorization within a Windows enterprise. 

See more on AD in the module:  :ref:`Introduction to Active Directory`
