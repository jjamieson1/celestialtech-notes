Description
*************
From Windows there are a variety of tools that can aid in our enumeration of the Domain.

- :ref:`sharphound`
- :ref:`bloodhound`
- :ref:`powerview`
- :ref:`sharpview`
- :ref:`group3r`
- :ref:`snaffler`

There are also some built in tools (from living off the land) to utilize as well.

We are also looking for misconfigurations, exposed files and domain trusts that can aid in our privilege escalation.
