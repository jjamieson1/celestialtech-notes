Enumeration Principals
****************************

Your main goal at this point is to evaluation all the possible ways to get foothold.  
Depending on the engagement you may need to be stealthy, adjust your method accordingly.

Consider the following:

1. What can we see 
2. What reasons are there for seeing it 
3. What image does what we see create for us
4. What do we gain from it 
5. What can we not see 
6. What reasons can there he that we do not see 
7. What image results for us from what we can not see
