Footprinting
**************

SNMPwalk
===========

Example 1: an unauthenticated request

.. code-block:: console

   snmpwalk -v2c -c public 10.129.14.128

onesixtone
============

This tool can be used to brute force the names of the community strings.
We can use a tool like :ref:`crunch` to create new word lists.

Example 1: Brute force community string

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt install onesixtyone
   onesixtyone -c /home/jjamieso/HTB/wordlist/SecLists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128

braa
========

Once we know the name of the community string we can use braa to brute
force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information.

Example 1: Install and use

.. code-block:: console

   sudo apt install braa
   braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*   # Syntax
   braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*
