Description
***************

This package contains Responder/MultiRelay, an LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS
poisoner. It will answer to specific NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service)
queries based on their name suffix
(see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409).
By default, the tool will only answer to File Server Service request,
which is for SMB.

The concept behind this is to target your answers, and be stealthier on
the network. This also helps to ensure that you donâ€™t break legitimate
NBT-NS behavior. You can set the -r option via command line if you want
to answer to the Workstation Service request name suffix.
