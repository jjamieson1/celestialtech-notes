***********

The risk level regarding Active Directory security has changed. Several vulnerabilities have been made popular with tools like mimikatz or sites likes adsecurity.org.

PingCastle is a tool designed to assess quickly the Active Directory security level with a methodology based on risk assessment and a maturity framework. It does not aim at a perfect evaluation but rather as an efficiency compromise.
