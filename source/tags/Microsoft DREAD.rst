************

Developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals evaluate the
severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. It is used to perform
a risk analysis by using a scale of 10 points to assess the severity of
security threats and vulnerabilities. With this, we calculate the risk
of a threat or vulnerability based on five main factors:

-  Damage Potential
-  Reproducibility
-  Exploitability
-  Affected Users
-  Discoverability
